## Project Overview

Air pollution is a critical issue affecting public health and the environment globally. This project leverages various data sources and machine learning models to forecast the concentration of air pollutants such as PM2.5, NO2, and CO. The goal is to enable proactive measures for air quality management.

## Features

- Data preprocessing and cleaning for air quality datasets
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) for pollutant trends
- Implementation of time series and regression models
- Visualization of forecasts and historical data
- Model evaluation and comparison

## Getting Started

Follow these instructions to set up the project and start experimenting with air quality forecasting.

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.7+
- pip (Python package manager)
- Jupyter Notebook (recommended for experimentation)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Vaggiri/Air-Quality-Forecasting.git
   cd Air-Quality-Forecasting
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

- Place your air quality dataset in the `data/` directory.
- Explore the `notebooks/` folder for Jupyter notebooks demonstrating data analysis and model training.
- Run the scripts in `src/` to preprocess data, train models, and generate forecasts.

Example:
```bash
python src/train_model.py --data data/air_quality.csv --output results/
```
